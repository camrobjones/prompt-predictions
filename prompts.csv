Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.
