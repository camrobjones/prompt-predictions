e.g. If the forecast due date is 2024-01-01 and we have the following data:
Date,'Battles'
2023-11-11,1
2023-10-10,2
to calculate the 30-day average of 'Battles' over the preceding 360 days, we’d have: (1+2)/12=0.25.

In this example, for the question to resolve positively, 1 or more 'Battles' would need to occur in the 30 days leading up to the resolution.
