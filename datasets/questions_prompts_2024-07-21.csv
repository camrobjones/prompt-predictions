Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving.

Will there be more 'Violence against civilians' in Bolivia for the 30 days before 2024-08-20 compared to the 30-day average of 'Violence against civilians' over the 360 days preceding 2024-07-21?

e.g. If the forecast due date is 2024-01-01 and we have the following data:
Date,'Violence against civilians'
2023-11-11,1
2023-10-10,2
to calculate the 30-day average of 'Violence against civilians' over the preceding 360 days, we’d have: (1+2)/12=0.25.

In this example, for the question to resolve positively, 1 or more 'Violence against civilians' would need to occur in the 30 days leading up to the resolution.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Will there be more than ten times as many fatalities in Ivory Coast for the 30 days before 2024-08-20 compared to one plus the 30-day average of fatalities over the 360 days preceding 2024-07-21?

e.g. If the forecast due date is 2024-01-01 and we have the following data:
Date,fatalities
2023-11-11,1
2023-10-10,2
to calculate one plus the 30-day average of fatalities over the preceding 360 days, we’d have: 1+(1+2)/12=1.25.

In this example, for the question to resolve positively, 13 (10 x 1.25) or more fatalities would need to occur in the 30 days leading up to the resolution.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Here are examples of forecasts for different questions to illustrate how to approach forecasting questions:

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.

Q1: Will India be the primary source of global GDP growth in 2026? A1: I'd give this a 65% chance. China's real estate sector problems will likely take years to unwind, while India's young workforce and growing middle class should maintain momentum. Major risks would be an oil price shock or political instability slowing reforms.

Q2: Will lab-grown meat products be available in major US grocery chains by 2026? A2: I'm at 40% on this one. While the technology is progressing and costs are falling, regulatory approval and scaling up production will take longer than optimists expect. Plus consumer acceptance remains a huge hurdle that will take time to overcome.

Q3: Will a non-English language TV show be the most watched streaming series globally in 2026? A3: I'd say 55%. The international streaming market is growing much faster than North America, and production quality from places like Korea and Spain keeps improving. Still, English-language content has built-in advantages in marketing and distribution that are hard to overcome.
